-- This code has been adapted from the module "GHC.AssertNF" of the package
-- <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/ghc-heap-view ghc-heap-view>
-- (<https://github.com/nomeata/ghc-heap-view GitHub>) authored by
-- Joachim Breitner.
--
-- To avoid space leaks and unwanted evaluation behaviour, the programmer might want his data to be fully evaluated at certain positions in the code. This can be enforced, for example, by ample use of "Control.DeepSeq", but this comes at a cost.
--
-- Experienced users hence use 'Control.DeepSeq.deepseq' only to find out about the existence of space leaks and optimize their code to not create the thunks in the first place, until the code no longer shows better performance with 'deepseq'.
--
-- This module provides an alternative approach: An explicit assertion about the evaluation state. If the programmer expect a certain value to be fully evaluated at a specific point of the program (e.g. before a call to 'writeIORef'), he can state that, and as long as assertions are enabled, this statement will be checked. In the production code the assertions can be disabled, to avoid the run-time cost.

-- | The function 'isNormalForm' checks whether its argument is fully evaluated

-- NOTE: The normal form check can be quite brittle, especially with @-O0@. For
-- example, writing something like
--
-- > let !(Value x) = ... in ....
--
-- might translate to
--
-- > let !.. = ... in ... (case ... of Value x -> x)
--
-- which would trivially be @False@. In general, 'isNormalForm' should probably
-- only be used with @-O1@, but even then the answer may still depend on
-- internal decisions made by ghc during compilation.
