-- | Bind to the C function to count the closure size
--
-- It is crucial that this function is marked unsafe, because GHC guarantees
-- that garbage collection will not occur during an unsafe call
-- (see <https://downloads.haskell.org/~ghc/latest/docs/html/users_guide/ffi-chap.html#guaranteed-call-safety>),
-- which is crucial for reliable counting (Haskell's GC moves objects around,
-- and so if a GC occurred during counting, we might end up counting objects
-- more than once or indeed miss them in the count if they happen to be moved to
-- a location we marked as already visited. This is also the reason that we
-- count the size of the object in C rather than in Haskell.

-- | Upper bound on the required work list size to compute closure size
--
-- NOTE: This ignores sharing, and so provides an upper bound only.
--
-- The size of a closure with no nested pointers can be computed without any
-- stack space.
--
-- When we have a closure with @(N + 1)@ nested pointers
--
-- > p0 p1 .. pN
--
-- We will
--
-- * Push @pN, .., p1, p0@ onto the stack
-- * Pop off @p0@ and count its children
-- * Pop off @p1@ and count its children
-- * ..
--
-- until we have processed all children. This means that the stack space
-- required will be the maximum of
--
-- > [ N + 1 -- For the initial list
-- > , requiredWorkList p0 + (N + 1) - 1
-- > , requiredWorkList p1 + (N + 1) - 2
-- > , ..
-- > , requiredWorkList pN + (N + 1) - (N + 1)
-- > ]
--
-- For example, for a list, we would get that
--
-- > requiredWorkList []     == 0
-- > requiredWorkList (x:xs) == max [ 2
-- >                                , requiredWorkList x + 1
-- >                                , requiredWorkList xs
-- >                                ]
--
-- which, for a list of @Int@ (which requires only a stack of size 1), equals 2
-- (unless the list is empty).
--
-- Similarly, for binary trees, we get
--
-- > requiredWorkList Leaf           == 0
-- > requiredWorkList (Branch l x r) == max [ 3
-- >                                        , requiredWorkList l + 2
-- >                                        , requiredWorkList x + 1
-- >                                        , requiredWorkList r
-- >                                        ]
